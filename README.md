Air Ticketing Forecast

● Business Problem:

An increase in direct booking from airlines will bring 
about a negative revenue impact to both ARC itself 
and the cooperated travel agencies.

● Project Objective:

Forecast the direct booking from airlines during 
2022 - 2024 to help ARC understand the big 
picture of post-covid air travel and come up with 
successful business strategies in advance.

Air Ticketing Forecast

● About Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC)
ARC accelerates growth for the travel industry and stakeholders who rely on travel analytics 
by delivering flexible distribution services, innovative financial solutions, and forwardlooking travel data.

What is the expected number of air tickets booked directly with Airlines (i.e. airline 
website) for the remainder of 2022 through the end of 2024? 

● Business Problem:

An increase in direct booking from airlines will bring 
about a negative revenue impact to both ARC itself 
and the cooperated travel agencies.

● Project Objective:

Forecast the direct booking from airlines during 
2022 - 2024 to help ARC understand the big 
picture of post-covid air travel and come up with 
successful business strategies in advance.

Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC) accelerates growth for the travel industry and serves for its cooporated travel agencies and partnered airlines.
Understanding future air travel is always a crucial issue for ARC as they wish to provide better settlement services and data solutions. 
This project aims to forecast the direct booking from airlines during 2022 - 2024 to help ARC understand the big 
picture of post-covid air travel and come up with successful business strategies in advance.

● Research Question:

What is the expected number of air tickets booked directly with Airlines (i.e. airline 
website) for the remainder of 2022 through the end of 2024? 

● Data:

ARC historical air ticketing data for US agencies, airline direct transactions (where available and permitted based on data sharing rules), 
along with non-US agency transactions (as permitted). 
Data is aggregated where required for use as well as anonymized (if needed) to adhere with data sharing rules.
